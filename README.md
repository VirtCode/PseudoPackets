# Pseudo Packets
A library to write quick pseudo packet communication.
### Disclaimer
As the name implies, this library does not use real networking packets. It uses the default java socket api to send data. The data is bundled in so called "Pseudo Packets". The main goal of this library is not to achieve the most efficient network communication but to make it easy to transmit data between servers and clients.
